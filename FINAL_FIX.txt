FINAL FIX - 2025-01-10 16:35

NUCLEAR APPROACH: Use ANCIENT supabase version that predates storage3 entirely

ANALYSIS FROM RAILWAY LOGS:
- Even supabase==1.0.3 STILL installs storage3==0.5.3
- The dependency chain: supabase → storage3 → dateutil → six.moves._thread
- NO VERSION of supabase 1.x+ works because they ALL depend on storage3

KEY WORKING VERSIONS:
- supabase==0.7.1               ← ANCIENT VERSION (no storage3 dependency at all)
- python-dateutil==2.8.2       ← Compatible version
- httpx==0.24.1                 ← Compatible with supabase 0.7.1
- six==1.16.0                   ← Latest
- pytz==2022.7                  ← Stable version

PORT FIXED: Works with shell expansion

STRATEGY: Go back to supabase 0.7.1 which was built BEFORE storage3 existed
