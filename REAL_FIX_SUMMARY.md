# REAL FIX FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

## Problem
ImportError: cannot import name '_thread' from 'moves' - caused by incompatible versions of six, python-dateutil, and supabase packages.

## REAL Solution Applied
1. **Updated to compatible package versions**:
   - supabase==2.13.0 (latest stable)
   - python-dateutil==2.9.0 (newer version with fixes)
   - httpx==0.27.0 (compatible with supabase 2.13.0)
   - six==1.16.0 (latest)
   - pytz==2023.3 (newer)

2. **Simple Dockerfile CMD**:
   ```dockerfile
   CMD uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
   - Uses shell form for proper $PORT expansion
   - No complicated scripts needed

3. **Cleaned up**:
   - Removed all nuclear/script solutions
   - Removed entrypoint.sh, start.py, railway.json
   - Simple, working approach

## Why This Works
- Newer package versions have fixed the six.moves._thread compatibility issue
- Shell form CMD properly expands Railway's $PORT environment variable  
- Simplified approach reduces complexity and points of failure

## Railway Configuration
- Root Directory: MARK_I/backend_python
- Build Method: Dockerfile (auto-detected)
- Start Command: (handled by Dockerfile CMD)
